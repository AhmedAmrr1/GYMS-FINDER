Gym Finder
==========

Gym Finder is a web application that helps users locate gyms near their current location. It uses the Geoapify API to search for gyms and the IPInfo API to determine the user's location based on their IP address. 
The application is built with Node.js, Express, and vanilla JavaScript, providing a simple and responsive user interface.

Features
--------

- **Location-Based Search**: Automatically detects the user's location using their IP address.
- **Gym Listings**: Displays a list of nearby gyms with details such as name, address, city, and district.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices with a clean, user-friendly interface.
- **Error Handling**: Provides feedback for failed API requests or when no gyms are found.


Tech Stack
----------

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript

- **GET /api/gyms**: Fetches a list of gyms near the user's location.
  - **Response**: JSON array of gym objects with ``name``, ``Address``, ``city``, and ``district`` fields.
  - **Example**:

Configuration
-------------

The ``constants.js`` file contains default settings for the gym search:

- **DEFAULT_RADIUS**: 10,000 meters (10km)
- **DEFAULT_LIMIT**: 10 gyms
- **CATEGORIES**: Filters for sports clubs and gym-related facilities

You can modify these values in ``src/config/constants.js`` to adjust the search behavior.
